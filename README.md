# Simplifie MapReduce in C++

## Project Overview

This project implements a simplified version of the popular **MapReduce** concept using C++ threads. The aim is to process sequences in parallel by applying a unary functor to elements of the sequence, followed by combining the results using a binary functor, all while dividing the work into multiple threads for concurrent execution.

The solution leverages `std::async` to handle thread management and allows for efficient processing without altering or copying the input sequence. Additionally, no synchronization primitives are used, as there are no shared mutable data between threads.

## Problem Statement

The task is to implement a function `map_reduce` that takes the following inputs:

- An iterator to the beginning of a sequence
- An iterator to the end of a sequence
- A unary functor that can be applied to elements of the sequence
- A binary functor that combines the results of applying the unary functor
- The number of threads to use for parallel processing
